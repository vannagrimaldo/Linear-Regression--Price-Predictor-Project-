# ReCell Dynamic Pricing Model for Used Devices

## Project Overview

As the global market for used and refurbished phones and tablets rapidly expands, companies like ReCell are seeking competitive pricing strategies. With the used phone market projected to be worth **$52.7 billion by 2023**, it is crucial to develop accurate pricing models for these devices. ReCell, a startup targeting this opportunity, has tasked us with building a machine learning solution to predict prices for used devices and identify key factors influencing pricing.

This project involves creating a **linear regression model** to predict the price of used phones and tablets based on a comprehensive dataset. The dataset includes attributes such as **brand, operating system, screen size, camera quality**, and other device specifications. The model aims to assist ReCell in offering competitive pricing while addressing market needs, promoting cost savings for consumers, and reducing environmental impact through device recycling.
